Want to be a penetration tester (pentester) in 2025? Here’s a simple guide with tips, tricks, and resources to start from zero and become a pro!

## 1. Learn the Basics
- What is pentesting? It’s testing systems for security weaknesses, like hackers do, but legally.
- Start with IT basics: Learn networks (TCP/IP, DNS), operating systems (Windows, Linux), and programming (Python, Bash).
- Tip: Use free courses on platforms like [TryHackMe](http://tryhackme.com/) for cybersecurity basics and [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for coding.

## 2. Master Pentesting Skills
- Tools to learn: Use Nmap for scanning, Metasploit for exploits, Burp Suite for web apps, and Wireshark for traffic analysis.
- Trick: Practice with `nmap -sS <target>` for stealth scans, or `sqlmap -u <url>` for SQL injection tests.
- Cheat: Keep a cheat sheet (like my notes on Linux, Windows, AD) for quick commands—save time!

## 3. Practice on Platforms
- From 0 to hero: Start with free platforms:
  - TryHackMe ([tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com/)): Easy rooms for beginners, like “Introduction to Pentesting.”
  - PortSwigger ([portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/)): Get knowlegde in WebApp/API/Web services penetration testing.
  - Hack The Box ([hackthebox.com](https://www.hackthebox.com/)): Harder challenges, free tier available for practice.
  - VulnHub ([vulnhub.com](https://www.vulnhub.com/)): Download VMs to hack safely.
- Tip: Spend 1–2 hours daily, focus on one skill (e.g., network scanning) per week.

## 4. Get Certifications
- Start small: Try to get any "Pentesting Learning path" certifications for basics ([tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com/)).
- Level up: Go for BSCP (Burp Suite Certified Professional) from [portswigger.net](https://portswigger.net/) — it’s tough but respected.
- Trick: Use practice exams and forums like Reddit’s r/NetSec or Discord communities.

## 5. Build a Portfolio
- Show your work: Create a blog (like this one!) or GitHub repo with pentest reports, tools you built, or CTF solutions.
- Reference: Check [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) for web app testing ideas or [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) for attack techniques.

## 6. Join the Community
- Network: Join forums like [Reddit r/NetSec](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/), [Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/), or [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/) for bug bounties.
- Trick: Attend free webinars or meetups to meet pentesters.
- Cheat: Follow experts on X (Twitter) for tips—use hashtags like #Pentesting or #Cybersecurity.

## 7. Stay Updated in 2025
- New tools: Learn cloud pentesting (AWS, Azure) with tools like Pacu.
- Tip: Read blogs on [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/) or [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/) for latest trends.
- Reference: Follow CVE reports on [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) for new vulnerabilities.

Start today, practice daily, and you’ll be a pentester in 2025—good luck, RedTeamer!
